      <h2>-Frequently asked questions that I have decided to answer here-</h2>
      <p><b>Q: What programs do you use to make music?</b></p>
      <p><b>A:</b> I use Garageband, microsoft paint, and other freeware to make my music. Everything I make is simply creativity for creativity's sake, and to share talent/express emotions.</p>
      <p><b>Q: How long have you been making music for?</b></p>
      <p><b>A:</b> I started making music early Senior year in highschool. I have been making music for almost 2 years, but I only started making it public a year ago.</p>
      <p><b>Q: What is the name of your mascot? How did you come up with her?</b></p>
      <p><b>A:</b> My mascot's name is Ace, and I came up with her probably when I was a Freshman in highschool. She has had many different looks over the years, but about a year ago I found a consistent design that I was pleased with.</p>
      <p><b>Q: Am I allowed to use your music for my own videos/animations?</b></p>
      <p><b>A:</b> Absolutely!! All of my works are under the CC license, (Creative Commons). As long as I am credited appropriately, I am more than happy for my music to be used.</p>
      <p><b>Q: Is fan-art of your mascot allowed?</b></p>
      <p><b>A:</b> Of course, I love fan-art as long as it is SFW/appropriate. Please take into consideration that Ace is a persona of myself, and as such, she means a lot to me.</p>
      <p><b>Q: What genre is your music?</b></p>
      <p><b>A:</b> To be perfectly honest, I don't have a consistent genre at all. I guess it would count as some form of "Experimental Dance Music" or run along the lines of "Trance".</p>
      <p><b>Q: What is your posting schedule?</b></p>
      <p><b>A:</b> I really don't have one as I am pretty consistently busy throughout the year with College, work, etc, and make music in my freetime.</p>
      <p><b>Q: How can I support you if you don't make money?</b></p>
      <p><b>A:</b> Just sharing or watching any of my music/animations is enough for me! Spreading the word is very much appreciated and every new viewer is a success to me.</p>
