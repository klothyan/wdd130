        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The home page is where I will introduce/describe the meaning of my webpage. It will include information on the type of music I make and explain the contents of the website. The first image will be the "hero", and it will take up a large portion of the top of the page. The bottom image will be just above the footer. The front page will be bright and flashy to attract the attention of the viewer, and it will be designed to look spacey, but still with a futuristic style in mind. The links at the top of the homepage will go to each different page, which will be labeled, "Releases", and "FAQ".

      </ul>
      <h3>Release List</h3>
      <p>
        Page 2 will have a list of all the tracks that I have released over the years. It will include EP's and single tracks and when each image is hovered over, it will show a link to the repective SoundCloud or YouTube link for each song or EP. This page will be a good way for people to see and understand how experienced I might be at this point in making music, how long each song or EP is, and also what the vibe of each piece of music is. This will be informative as other people might be considering making their own music and can be able to see what kind of things you should add to your music to know how to attract the attention of others and gain recognition.

      <h3>FAQ</h3>
      <p>
        Page 3 is based upon the FAQ where I will be answering hypothetical questions about my music, art, and other things that people might want to know about me and my history with making music and art. My FAQ will help others be able to understand what has been my main influence for making music, how I make music, and other potentially interesting facts that they might want to know about. Visitors will want to look at my FAQ in order to get to know me, the artist, more. This is because I am a fairly silent/quiet individual on my public social media accounts, and rarely interact with others.

      <p>Overall site information:</p>
      <p>Overall, my website will be a good place for viewers who are either interested in my music just to listen to the type of music that I have to offer, or because they might be curious in exactly what it takes to produce this type of music, my website will have a good experience for everyone who might want to look at it. Visitors will want to look at my release list and be able to hear different songs as they look at and scroll on the website. This will give them a very interactive experience so they will be able to listen to each of my songs/my music while they are viewing things on the website. This website is completely authentic as the only other way to find me on the internet is on my socials, of which I keep my information about myself pretty hidden and discreet as I don't want people who view my works or who follow me to be able to have that access to my own personal information. I make music just to make music. It is simply creativity for creativity's sake, and I do not get any money from making my music. As such, I tend to use Freeware, (such as MS Paint, Adobe Express, GarageBand, Ocean, BandLab, etc.) to make my music. This creates an interesting and authentic look for the type of music that I create. If you'd like to find some experimental and interesting beats, please check out my music!! </p>
